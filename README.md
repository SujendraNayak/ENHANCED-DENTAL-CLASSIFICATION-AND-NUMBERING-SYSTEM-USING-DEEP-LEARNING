# ENHANCED-DENTAL-CLASSIFICATION-AND-NUMBERING-SYSTEM-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
### Introduction  
The **Enhanced Dental Classification and Numbering System Using Deep Learning** is designed to revolutionize dental healthcare by automating the process of analyzing dental images. Traditional dental classification methods are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This project leverages deep learning to create a more accurate, efficient, and scalable solution for classifying dental X-rays and assigning unique identifiers to teeth based on standard numbering systems.  
The system integrates advanced image processing techniques with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to:  
- Detect and classify dental features such as crowns, fillings, cavities, or abnormalities.  
- Assign dental numbers to teeth for mapping and identification.  
This solution aims to support dentists in diagnostic procedures, treatment planning, and patient record-keeping, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency.

### Methodology  
The project workflow is divided into several stages:  

#### 1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
- **Data Sources:** Dental X-rays and intraoral images were collected from public datasets or hospitals.  
- **Annotation:** Images were annotated for various dental features (tooth types, conditions, and numbers).  
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Resizing images to a uniform resolution.  
  - Normalizing pixel intensity values for better model performance.  
  - Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming were used to create a robust dataset.

#### 2. **Model Development**  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**  
  - A CNN architecture was developed with layers optimized for feature extraction and classification.  
  - The architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for prediction.  
- **Transfer Learning:** Pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet50 were fine-tuned for faster convergence and higher accuracy.  

#### 3. **Classification and Numbering**  
- The model outputs both:  
  - Dental classifications (e.g., crown, root canal, or cavity).  
  - Standard numbering based on dental charts (e.g., FDI World Dental Federation notation).

#### 4. **Training and Validation**  
- **Training:**  
  - Dataset was split into training and validation sets.  
  - The Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss were used to optimize the model.  
  - Regularization techniques like dropout were applied to avoid overfitting.  
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate model performance.  

#### 5. **Testing and Deployment**  
- The trained model was tested on unseen data to evaluate its robustness.  
- A user-friendly interface was developed to allow dentists to upload images and receive predictions.  

#### 6. **Integration with Healthcare Systems**  
- The system was integrated with electronic dental records for seamless workflow.
