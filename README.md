###ü¶∑ ENHANCED DENTAL CLASSIFICATION AND NUMBERING SYSTEM USING DEEP LEARNING
üìå Introduction
The Enhanced Dental Classification and Numbering System Using Deep Learning aims to revolutionize dental healthcare by automating dental X-ray analysis. Traditional dental classification methods are manual, time-consuming, and prone to human errors. This system leverages deep learning (CNN) to accurately classify dental features and automatically assign tooth numbers based on standardized numbering systems.

‚úÖ Key Features:

Automated detection of teeth and dental features.

Tooth numbering using FDI World Dental Federation notation.

Accurate classification of dental conditions (crowns, cavities, root canals, etc.).

Integration with dental records for clinical use.

üõ† Methodology
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection and Preprocessing
Dental X-rays collected from public datasets and hospitals.

Images annotated for tooth positions and conditions.

Preprocessing steps:

Resizing images to a fixed resolution.

Normalization for uniform pixel intensity.

Data Augmentation: Rotation, flipping, and zooming to improve generalization.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Architecture
Backbone network: ResNet 50/101 with FPN (Feature Pyramid Network).

Region Proposal Network (RPN) for generating candidate tooth regions.

RoI Align for feature extraction and segmentation.

Three branches:

Mask: For tooth segmentation.

Coordinates: For bounding box regression.

Category: For classification of teeth.
